cromdisk compressed ROM disk
----------------------------

cromdisk is a simple compressed ROM block device. It uses a ROM image
generated by an offline tool and provides random access to it; it's a drop-in
replacement to ramdisk (although, naturally, read only).

It achieves random access by individually compressing each 512 byte block.
This means that the compression ratio isn't that great, but it's achieving
about 2:1 in my experience, which makes it useful when ROM space is tight.
Decompression is done using zlib's puff lightweight deflator. This isn't
nearly as fast as true zlib, but it's only about 3kB of code.  

There are no configuration options.

You can't enable ramdisk and cromdisk at the same time, as they both try to
register /dev/ram0. (Besides, raw access to the compressed data probably
isn't useful.)
